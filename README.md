# DiscordDraftBot

This is an attempt at a Discord Snake Draft Bot!
For those that have heard of games like Fantasy football, this may be familiar to you!

We first start with a list of items, here I have included pokemon, but can be replaced with sports players, or any list for that matter.
We then can create a list of people that want to participate in this draft.
After this list has been created, we can start the draft.

for a draft of 4 people, snake draft would look like
1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 4 -> 3 -> 2 -> 1

This discord bot allows that to happen!
It includes notifying people when it's their turn, making sure users can't draft the same item, and more!

The last issue I need to solve for this is to create a wait system, as the code seems to ignore the need to wait for players to draft their choice, and moves immediately to the next item. 


For the future, I am looking to have it so that the data is saved, as well as introducing a point system? (Some items are worth more than others, and you are given a maximum amount of points from the start).
